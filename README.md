# Movies Showcase

Stream Two Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

The main goal of this project is to generate and populate website content using JavaScript and external database. 

With the help of www.themoviedb.org API I have made a movies showcase.

## Demo

Live demonstration of a website can be found by the folowing link: https://yiaoma.github.io/Interactive-Frontend-Development-Project/.

## UX

The idea behind designing this project was to make user feel like they are using an application rather than a website. My goal was to make it simple and easy to use.

## Technologies

    1. HTML
    2. CSS
    3. JavaScript
    4. FontAwesome

## Features

    1. Pagination - allows users to navigate through website pages.
    2. Sort button - allows users to sort movies by popular, top rated and upcoming.
    3. Movie details - by clicking on the specific movie poster displayed on showcase you can access the movie details view which provides more information about the movie, such as title, release date, rating and overview.

## Testing

This website was manually tested on  Mozilla FireFox and Google Chrome web browsers, both desktop and mobile to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

## Deployment

The live website is desployed on GitHub pages.
